## Hello!

I'm a full-time developer at SAP Labs Latin America and also a developer for passion.

I fell in love with development when I learned I could use my logic brain to make beautiful things, while I had absolutely no artistic skill.

For me, making good code is like drawing a painting, and as drawing, it is sometimes stressful, but in the end it's all worth it and satisfactory.
Plus, we can always learn with mistakes and improve ourselves, and unlike paintings, we can delete some lines and refactor them in the future ;)

Lately I've been trying to learn some Unity development aswell, but it's being hard to find the time and peace for that during the COVID outbreak. 
Being quarentined takes away part of my will for learning new technologies, specially the missing barrier between work and life.
